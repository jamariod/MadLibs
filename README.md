# MadLibs
Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.  To clear the textfields and restart the game I added a shake gesture. This app is written completely in Swift 5.
